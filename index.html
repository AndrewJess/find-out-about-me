        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello, Thanks for having a look at my web page. I am Andrew Jess and I am starting a new career in IT.
        <br>
        I am very excited to get started in such a fast moving and forward thinking indusrty. 
        <br>
    I believe that what I have learnt in the world of work so far will bring a different dynamic to my IT career that will help to look at things from a different view point.
    <br>
    <br>
    In my free time recently I have been enjoying using the Codecademy platform to learn and practice my new skills but beofre that,
    <br> 
    I would enjoy caravan trips with my family and taking our dog Oscar on walks at the beach or in the beautiful parklands Northern Ireland has to offer.</p>



        <!-------------------------Career History-------------------------------------------->
        <h2>What did I do before IT?</h2>
        <p>I have worked in the world of optics for the last 15 years with the day to day role of esuring patients get the best eyewear to suit their needs.
        <br>
        Having honed my leardership and management skills completing diplomas in Performance Coaching and Leadership Management I enjoy running the business and looking after a team of 13 great people.
        <br>
